## Inspiration
Estimating the fire risk is one of the important contents of the fire protection design. Modern techniques have to replace the conventional and out-of-date techniques used by fire services among the world and cost hundreds of human lives annually.

## What it does
OnFire uses data from past fires and using machine learning techinques, estimates the fire risk for East Attica's Natura 2000 protected areas

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We participated in a hackathon, we stayed awake for 24 hours and we were the only team with a working demo.

## Built With
Python(Flask), Javascript(JQuery), Data from The Hellenic Fire Service
